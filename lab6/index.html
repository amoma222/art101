<h1> Challenge </h1>
	<p> Create an array and an object in javascript.</p>
<h1> Problems </h1>
	<p> We struggled a bit creating our object in the console because we
		weren't completely sure if we were making it and/or formating it correctly.
	Our javascript isn't showing up either and we aren't sure why. </p>
<h1> Results </h1>
<p> Everything else in our html is working just fine </p>
