	<h1> Lab 3: File Structures </h1>

	<p> For this lab I had to create a local file structure on my computer,
		add html index files, and then upload them to a server.

<h2>Challenges</h2>
		I had issues uploading
		the images into my html, not entirely sure why.

<h3>Results</h3>
		Besides my images, everything
		else worked fine. Here is my html.
